## 🇳🇵 The Problem

Land ownership in Nepal relies on the centuries-old "Dhadda" (paper ledger) system. This creates serious problems:

1. **Lost Records**: Paper documents (Lal Purja) deteriorate, burn in fires, or simply go missing
2. **Fraud & Double Selling**: The same plot gets sold to multiple buyers due to no instant verification
3. **Easy Tampering**: Bribes can alter official records
4. **Bureaucratic Hell**: Transferring ownership takes weeks of running between offices

## 🚀 Our Solution

We're putting land records on the **Solana Blockchain** - making them permanent, transparent, and impossible to forge.

### Why Blockchain?
- **Immutable**: Once recorded, no one can secretly alter ownership records
- **Transparent**: Anyone can verify land ownership instantly
- **Decentralized**: Records distributed across thousands of nodes globally

### Why Solana?
- **Fast**: Transactions confirm in under a second
- **Cheap**: Costs fractions of a rupee per transaction ($0.00025)
- **Scalable**: Can handle Nepal's entire land registry

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Rust** (1.70+)
- **Solana CLI** (1.18+)
- **Anchor CLI** (0.30.1+)
- **Node.js** (18+)
- **Phantom Wallet** extension

### Wallet Setup
1. Open your Phantom wallet
2. Go to **Settings** → **Developer Settings**
3. Turn **Testnet Mode** ON
4. Change network to **Localhost** (`127.0.0.1:8899`)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/XGPher35/LandRegistry.git
cd LandRegistry

# Install frontend dependencies
cd frontend
npm install
cd ..
```

### Start Local Blockchain

```bash
# In a new terminal - keep this running
solana-test-validator --reset
```

### Build & Deploy Smart Contract

```bash
# Build the program
anchor build

# Sync program keys
anchor keys sync

# Rebuild with synced key
anchor build

# Fund your wallet
solana airdrop 5

# Deploy
anchor deploy
```

### 🚨 Local-First Prototype Disclaimer
**Why no live link?** This project is a working prototype designed specifically for **Solana Localnet/Devnet**. Because land registry involves sensitive government-level verification simulation, it is best demonstrated in a controlled environment to show the full multi-party approval flow (Buyer + Government). 

**Demo Video available in the submission portal!**

### 🎬 Step-by-Step Demo Flow
To test the full capability of the dApp, follow this sequence:

1. **Gov Setup**: Connect your wallet as the "Government" official (using the `GOV_KEY` in `lib.rs`).
2. **Register Land**: Go to the **Government Dashboard** and register a new land (e.g., ID `123`, Location `Kathmandu`).
3. **Initiate Transfer**: Switch wallet to **Person 1** (Land Owner). Go to **My Land**, click **View Details** on your land, and click **Initiate Transfer**. Enter **Person 2's** wallet address.
4. **Buyer Approval**: Switch wallet to **Person 2**. Go to **Owner Portal**. You will see an **Incoming Transfer**. Click **Approve & Accept**.
5. **Gov Final Approval**: Switch back to **Government** wallet. Go to **Government Dashboard**. You will see the **Pending Transfer**. Click **Approve**.
6. **Verification**: Go to the **Public Portal** and search for ID `123`. You will now see **Person 2** as the new verified owner with a full transfer history!

## 📈 Roadmap

- ✅ **Phase 1**: Core land registry and transfer system
- 🔲 **Phase 2**: Document storage via IPFS
- 🔲 **Phase 3**: Mobile app for rural areas
- 🔲 **Phase 4**: SMS notifications for transfers
- 🔲 **Phase 5**: Integration with Nepal government systems

## 🔒 Security

**Current System**: A corrupt clerk can make your land disappear overnight.

**Our System**: Your ownership is cryptographically secured. To steal your land, someone would need to:
- Hack your Phantom wallet (requires your 12-word secret phrase)
- Forge your digital signature (mathematically impossible)
- Compromise the entire Solana network (thousands of validators)

Even bribing officials won't work - they cannot change blockchain records.
